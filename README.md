# SimpleSky
SimpleSky is a web forecast app I created using `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`. I used handy tools like Webpack for organization, `ESLint` for keeping the code in check, and `Prettier` for code formatting. It lets you check the weather in both metric and imperial units, enjoy animated forecasts, and peek at the week ahead.
